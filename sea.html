        <h1>The Silent Crisis: Unveiling the Menace of Sea Pollution</h1>
        <section class="hazard">
            <p>The world's oceans, covering more than 70% of the Earth's surface, are essential to life on our planet. Unfortunately, they are facing an insidious threat that is growing at an alarming rate â€“ sea pollution. As human activities intensify, our oceans are becoming increasingly polluted, posing severe consequences for marine life, ecosystems, and ultimately, human well-being.</p>

                <p>Sea pollution originates from various sources, with human activities being the primary contributors. Industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, improper waste disposal, and oil spills are among the leading culprits. Plastic waste, one of the most pervasive pollutants, has garnered global attention for its detrimental impact on marine environments. Discarded plastics break down into microplastics, infiltrating the ocean food chain and causing widespread harm to marine life.</p>

            <h2>Impact on Marine Life:</h2>
            <p>Sea pollution has devastating effects on marine ecosystems and the diverse life forms they support. Oil spills create catastrophic events, coating marine animals and birds in a deadly slick, while toxic chemicals from industrial discharges compromise the health of aquatic organisms. Plastics entangle marine life, leading to injury and death, and the ingestion of microplastics by fish and other species can have long-term consequences, affecting their reproduction and overall health.</p>

                <p> <b><span style="color: black; font-size: 20px;">Economic Consequences:</span> </b><br>The consequences of sea pollution extend beyond ecological impacts to economic repercussions. Coastal economies that rely on fishing and tourism suffer when pollution disrupts marine ecosystems. The degradation of fisheries, loss of biodiversity, and the decline in water quality have far-reaching effects on livelihoods, particularly in developing nations where communities are heavily dependent on marine resources.</p>
